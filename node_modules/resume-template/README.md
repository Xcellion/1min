# Portfolio / Resume Template

A simple and clean portfolio / resume design. Modular SASS files; one CSS file output.

## Install with NPM

```
npm install resume-template
```

You may find the package here: [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/resume-template).

## One CSS File

Portfolio-templates is ultimately one single CSS file. There is no JavaScript included with this package.

## Editing

The final CSS output file is made up of 4 folder containing SCSS / SASS files: components, elements, misc, and structures. You can edit the SCSS files directly and compile them to CSS files using build tools like Gulp, Grunt, Node-sass, etc. Alternatively, you can edit the portfolio.css file (if you don't understand SASS), however, I do not recommend this method at all.
